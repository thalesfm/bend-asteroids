# Asteroids

A simple Asteroids clone written in [Bend](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend) (WIP).

Implemented in a purely-functional style, with a graphics backend written in Rust.


## Build

To compile from source, simply run `cargo build`
(requires that [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) be installed in your system).

Similarly, `cargo run` will execute the program.
